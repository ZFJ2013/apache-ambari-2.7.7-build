# CommonJS for the browser
This package is a fork of the [brunch.io](http://brunch.io) use of CommonJS. It was created for projects that desire to use Common JS and be agnostic to any build tools.

## Usage
Include the `common.js` file at the beginning of your app, or include using bower:

    bower install commonjs
